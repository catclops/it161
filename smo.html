           <h2>Social Media Optimization (SMO)</h2>
           <p>The worlds’ population grows and the reliance on technology and the internet has made a vast change in the role of social media when it comes to modern consumers. Social Media Optimization is “essentially using social media as a catalyst to grow your company’s online presence,... SMO is about strategically creating, building and maximizing your social media plan to connect with your target audience” (Jackson). Ultimately, a social media presence for a company is to strengthen their brand  in order to sell more and this cannot be overstated: the difference between a good and a bad social media strategy has been known to make or break a company. 
    In order to highlight the importance of social media in this new consumer landscape, it’s important to demonstrate what social media optimization or SMO as it is more popularly known is in our day to day lives. SMo includes “the use of social media sites, video sites as well as RSS feed, bookmarking sites and blogging sites for driving traffic to the website and improving the site’s organic search results” (Deshpande). Deshpande makes the additional point that publishing content on social media networks is designed to encourage sharing and to foster engagement. Anytime you share a website through facebook or instagram or a RSS feed are common examples of how this tactic is used. Companies are extremely savvy to the importance of this new marketing strategy but it hasn’t been exactly addressed as to why it is so important.
SMO has many parallels to the techniques of viral marketing and the basic tactics haven’t changed much. SMO relies on communication through social media networks to generate buzz in order to preserve or to grow a company’s online presence. It can be used to “increase awareness of new products and services, connect with customers, and ameliorate potential damaging news” (Kenton). SMO has essentially become a conglomerate of marketing, personal relations, advertising, social media, and polling. A company that ignores SMO as an asset that can organically grow their organization would either be foolish or out of touch with the reality of consumer relations.
