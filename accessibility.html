           <h2>Accessibility</h2>
           <p>The essential function of the Web in conjunction with the internet is to exchange information over a digital platform with other users around the globe. Web accessibility is absolutely vital in order to uphold this basic purpose of the internet. The W3C described web accessibility as the “means that websites, tools, and technologies are designed and developed so that people with disabilities can use them” (Web Accessibility Initiative). The variety of disabilities includes “all visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, and all other neurological disabilities that make it difficult or impossible to use any website” (Walker). 
    To put the importance of accessibility into a better perspective, around 15% of the world’s population, to include about 19% of American people, are disabled (Walker). This enormous figure would equate to roughly a billion people worldwide and it is impossible to ignore this figure.To blatantly ignore the importance of accessibility in the development of a new website would be a serious violation of the morals, ethics, and responsibilities a creator owes to their consumers. 
However, putting aside the moral responsibilities a creator has to their consumers, web accessibility garners loyalty and trust to potential customers: the two hallmarks of a successful business. The benefits of accessibility not only favor disabled users but also everyone. Web accessibility “helps you rank better on search engines, improve conversion rates, optimize your site's overall performance and create more loyal and satisfied users” (Gevorkian).
Though it seems daunting to incorporate additional features to improve web accessibility, there are a multitude of resources and tools available online to help. The W3C Web Accessibility Initiative developed several comprehensive lists, guidelines. and references on the accessibility solutions. The Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) also has a list of standards in incorporating these features into web applications that benefit disabled people. Ultimately, “access to information and communications technologies, including the Web, is defined as a basic human right in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities” (Web Accessibility Initiative). With the rapid growth in technology and the unending growth of the world’s population, the importance of accessibility in web design is mandatory to the natural and organic growth of the internet.
